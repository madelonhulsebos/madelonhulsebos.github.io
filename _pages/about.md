I'm a faculty at CWI where I lead the <a href="https://trl-lab.github.io" target="blank">Table Representation Learning (TRL) Lab</a> and am member of the Database Architectures group. I'm also faculty at ELLIS Amsterdam.

My research is focused on table representation learning (TRL), generative models and systems for tabular data. Tables are prevalent in the data landscape, contain valuable data, and fuel important decisions in organizations in governments, industry, and healthcare. My objective, therefore, is to <i>democratize insights from structured data</i> ✨. My research has been supported by an NWO AiNed grant, BIDS-Accenture Fellowship, and industry sponsors. You can find an overview of my research interests below.

To establish tabular data as a key modality for AI, akin to images and text, I've been driving TRL initatives since 2020. In particular, I founded the <a href="https://table-representation-learning.github.io/NeurIPS2024/" target="blank">Table Representation Learning workshop series</a> at NeurIPS and ACL, established the TRL research theme at ELLIS Amsterdam, and organize related efforts. I'm reviewing for various tracks/workshops at e.g. VLDB, SIGMOD, NeurIPS, ICLR, and others.

Previously, I did a postdoc at UC Berkeley and obtained my PhD from the University of Amsterdam during which I spent time at MIT and Sigma Computing. Before academia, I spent 2+ years in industry working on ML-driven automated data analysis tools. Full <a href="/assets/pdf/CV.pdf" target="blank"><b>CV</b></a>.


Some research interests and contributions in TRL in line with my vision for democratizing insights from structured data:
<ul>
<li><b>Tabular insight extraction</b>: LLM robustness for <a href="https://aclanthology.org/2025.trl-1.21.pdf" target="blank">tabular reasoning</a>, <a href="https://target-benchmark.github.io/" target="blank">TARGET benchmark of table retrieval</a> in e2e querying.</li>
<li><b>Dataset search</b>: vision and insights on <a href="https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/3665939.3665959" target="blank">dataset search systems</a>, proactive task-based dataset search, e.g. <a href="https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/3746059.3747727" target="blank">DataScout</a>.</li>
<li><b>Tabular data semantics</b>: semantic type detection in tabular data, e.g. <a href="https://sherlock.media.mit.edu/" target="blank">Sherlock</a>, <i>contextual</i> <a href="https://indico.un.org/event/1016405/contributions/592/attachments/22957/65273/SDC2025_Sc_CWI-OCHA_Hulsebos.pdf" target="blank">sensitive data detection</a>.</li>
<li><b>Table embeddings</b>: <a href="https://www.vldb.org/pvldb/vol17/p849-cong.pdf" target="blank">Observatory</a> on relational properties in table embeddings, role of <a href="https://openreview.net/pdf?id=rELWIvq2Qy" target="blank">embedding metadata in table retrieval</a>.</li>
<li><b>Large datasets for tabular learning</b>: <a href="https://gittables.github.io/" target="blank">GitTables</a> with 1M+ real-world tables, <a href="https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/3654975" target="blank">SchemaPile</a> with real-world DB schemas.</li>
</ul>

Other topics I am working on are: ML-powered tabular predictive insights, generative models for tabular data, and beyond.
