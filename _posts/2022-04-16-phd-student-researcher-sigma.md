I am thrilled to join Sigma Computing again to continue my work on table representation models, making them work in practice, and deploying them in various applications.

Doing my research at Sigma, allows me to get input from customers, engineers, etc., integrate my research outcomes in Sigma's products, and experience the vivid and challenging startup culture!
