Excited to organize the third edition of the <a href="https://table-representation-learning.github.io/" target="blank">Table Representation Learning workshop at NeurIPS 2024</a>! Besides hosting the latest work on models/performance/applications of representation learning and generative models over tables (looking forward!), we'll have some exciting announcements to share with the TRL community..
