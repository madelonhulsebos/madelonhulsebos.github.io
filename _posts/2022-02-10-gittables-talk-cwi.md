I gave a talk about GitTables at the Database Architectures group at Centrum Wiskunde & Informatica; watch it on YouTube [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jEBKcmdIFzw). We had many interesting discussions that led to new research ideas. If you have any questions about it feel free to reach out.
