I gave a talk about GitTables at the Database Architectures group at Centrum Wiskunde & Informatica. Watch the talk on YouTube [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jEBKcmdIFzw), or download the slides <a href="/assets/GitTables (slides).pdf" target="_blank">here</a>

We had many interesting discussions that led to new research ideas. If you have any questions about it, or suggestions for future work, please reach out. Many thanks to Peter Boncz, Hannes Muehleisen and Stefan Manegold for having me!
