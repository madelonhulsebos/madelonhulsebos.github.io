Very excited to have established the new research theme on Table Representation Learning at <a href="https://ivi.fnwi.uva.nl/ellis/research/table-representation-learning/" target="blank">ELLIS unit Amsterdam</a>! From this establishment, I will soono organize a monthly seminar and workshops on TRL. The first <a href="https://sites.google.com/view/rl-and-gm-for-sd" target="blank">ELLIS workshop around TRL</a> is on 28 February in Amsterdam. Stay tuned!
