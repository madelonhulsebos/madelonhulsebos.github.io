As I am moving back from the Bay Area to Amsterdam -- permanently, this time :) -- I am very excited to give my research around TRL (stronger) roots in Europe. As a start to this, it is great to share that I have become a member of the ELLIS Society! Expect some "TRL in Europe" initatives to come soon..!
