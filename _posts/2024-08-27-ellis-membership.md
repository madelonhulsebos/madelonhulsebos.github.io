As I am moving back from the Bay Area to Amsterdam -- permanently, this time :) -- I am very excited to become member of the European Laboratory for Learning and Intelligent Systems (<a href="https://ellis.eu/">ELLIS</a>) society, and strengthen the roots of my research around TRL in Europe. Expect some "TRL in Europe" initatives to come soon..!
