I'm co-organizing a workshop on Data Management for End-to-End Machine Learning (DEEM) at SIGMOD 2023. Read more <a href="http://deem-workshop.org/" target="_blank">here</a>, and I hope to see you in Seattle soon!

DEEM is the excellent venue for early research proposals, industry insights and developments, and analysis reports on data management challenges/systems for ML and other analytics applications. This direction is important given the rise of data management challenges arising from deployment of ML models. Check <a href="http://deem-workshop.org/" target="_blank">the website</a> for the full scope and schedule (TBA)!
