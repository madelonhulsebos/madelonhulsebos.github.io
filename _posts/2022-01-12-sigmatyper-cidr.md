I gave a short presentation at CIDR about my internship project at Sigma Computing regarding "Making Table Understanding Work in Practice". This presentation is published on YouTube [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-BE5rWNMXnU).

This project is still work in progress and I look forward to develop it further at Sigma. Stay tuned!
