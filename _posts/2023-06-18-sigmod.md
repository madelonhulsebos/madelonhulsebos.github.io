Excited to attend <a href="https://2023.sigmod.org/" target="blank">SIGMOD</a> this week!

On Monday, I'll co-organize the workshop on <a href="https://deem-workshop.org/" target="blank">Data Management for E2E ML (DEEM)</a>. On Thursday, the moment has come to (finally) present <a href="https://gittables.github.io">GitTables</a>, which is neatly followed by a tutorial on Neural Table Representations on Friday. Looking very much forward to hearing your thoughts on this line of work, and discuss parallel research as well!
