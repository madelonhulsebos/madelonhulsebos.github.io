I'm excited to give a (3-hour!) tutorial at SIGMOD 2023 about Models and Practice of Neural Table Representations together with Xiang Deng, Huan Sun, and Paolo Papotti. This tutorial will give an overview of the field and hands-on session.

Specifically, we will discuss the latest advances, challenges and opportunities, and guide a hands-on session where we will go through several phases from data preprocessing to model fine-tuning and analysis.

This SIGMOD will be busy, and I look forward to seeing you there!
