We released an improved version of the [Sherlock](https://sherlock.media.mit.edu/) codebase, [check it out on GitHub](https://github.com/mitmedialab/sherlock-project).

Many of these improvements were contributed by [Chris Lowe](https://www.linkedin.com/in/chris-lowe-65706911/), thanks Chris!

This fixes a few bugs, makes the code for feature extraction *much* faster, and includes the code of the original model to enable adaptation. We also created a notebook to show how Sherlock can be used out-of-the-box.
