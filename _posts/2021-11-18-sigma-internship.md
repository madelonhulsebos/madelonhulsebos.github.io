My industrial research journey started in June 2021 at <a href="https://www.sigmacomputing.com/" target="_blank"> Sigma Computing</a> where I started as a research intern for 3 months. It's been an amazing experience!

Although I stayed working from Amsterdam in the Netherlands, I was able to enjoy the energetic and ambitious environment since most colleagues were working from home due to covid restrictions.

During my internship I worked on two different projects. First, I worked on prototyping a system for data-driven decision making. Second, I worked on developing a framework and system for semantic type detection in practice. Both projects will be presented at CIDR next January!

As I continue to work at Sigma, I really look forward to meeting the team in person in January. I will travel to San Francisco and visit CIDR as well. I would be pleased to meet other CIDR participants!
