I am excited to support the [Journal of Systems Research (JSys)](http://jsys.org/) as an Assistant Editor. The strong principles around open science, transparency, and rigor motivated me to apply for this position.

As Assistant Editor, I will be mainly involved in assisting the Editors-in-Chief. With that, I will get more experience with managing a journal and editorial processes. This position will also reinforce my attention for Open Science initiatives.
