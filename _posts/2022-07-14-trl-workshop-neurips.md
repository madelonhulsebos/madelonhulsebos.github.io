I'm co-organizing a workshop on Table Representation Learning (TRL) at NeurIPS 2022. Read more <a href="https://table-representation-learning.github.io" target="_blank">here</a>, and I hope to see you in New Orleans very soon!

Our goals are twofold: 1) to motivate tabular data as a first-class and important new modality for table representation learning, and 2) to bring the data management and machine learning together to advance this emerging research direction further. It promises to get an exciting workshop with many interesting speakers and discussions.
