I gave a talk about "Large Table Models for enterprise data management" at the KomPAKI seminar at TU Darmstadt which brings together AI and DB researchers.

We had many interesting discussions that led to new research ideas and even improvements on ongoing projects. Bringing AI and DB research groups together made it especially interesting. Many thanks to Carsten Binnig and Kristian Kersting for having me!
