We released <a href="https://gittables.github.io" target="_blank">GitTables</a>, a large-scale dataset of 1.7M relational tables extracted from CSV files in GitHub. The high interest in <a href="https://sherlock.media.mit.edu" target="_blank">Sherlock</a> (a deep learning model for semantic data type detection) from organizations motivated the creation of GitTables, as the out-of-the-box applicability of Sherlock in industry was low. This was mainly due to the training data, which consisted of tables extracted from HTML pages annotated with 78 semantic types. These tables and semantics poorly generalized to tables beyond the Web. GitTables is meant to close this gap.
