title: "Release of GitTables: A Large-Scale Corpus of Relational Tables."
categories: Projects
---

My main motivation for building GitTables was the high interest in Sherlock from organizations, mostly medical. Although the interest was high, the out-of-the-box applicability was low. This was mainly due to the table corpus that Sherlock was trained on, which consisted of tables extracted from HTML pages. Actually, all existing large-scale table corpora consist of tables from the Web, like WebTables, WikiTables, etc. Such tables poorly represent tables beyond the Web, as they are much smaller and less heterogeneous. GitTables is meant to facilitate large-scale training and evaluation of relational table models for enterprises, medical organizations, and governmental institutions.
