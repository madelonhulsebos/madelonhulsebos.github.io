title: "Release of GitTables: A Large-Scale Corpus of Relational Tables."
categories: Projects
---

For building GitTables, I was mainly motivated by the excessive interest in Sherlock from companies, mostly medical, that were not able to leverage the pretrained model that Sherlock provided.
This limited applicability of Sherlock was mainly due to the table corpus it was trained on, which mainly consisted of tables extracted from HTML pages. Actually, the primary existing large-scale table corpora consist of tables from the Web, like WebTables, WikiTables, etc. While analysing GitTables, we found that such tables poorly represent tables beyond the Web, as they are much smaller and less heterogeneous. GitTables is meant to facilitate large-scale training and evaluation of relational table models for enterprises, medical organizations, and governmental institutions.
