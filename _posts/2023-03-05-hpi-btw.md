Excited to attend the workshop on <a href="https://sites.google.com/view/btw-2023-tud/program/workshops/w1-ml-for-systems-and-systems-for-ml" target="blank">ML for Systems and Systems for ML at BTW 2023</a> and visit the Hasso-Plattner Institute. At both, I'll give a talk about learned table models.
