Excited to attend the workshop on <a href="https://sites.google.com/view/btw-2023-tud/program/workshops/w1-ml-for-systems-and-systems-for-ml" target="blank">ML for Systems and Systems for ML at BTW 2023</a> and visit the Information Systems group at Hasso-Plattner Institute. At both occassions, I'll give a talk about (learning representations of) tables. See the <a href="../assets/Towards_TRL_DM_DA.pdf" target="blank">slides of my talk here</a>.
