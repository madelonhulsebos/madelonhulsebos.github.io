Excited to attend the workshop on ML for Systems and Systems for ML at BTW 2023 and visit the Information Systems group at Hasso-Plattner Institute in Potsdam, on my way there. At both occassions, I look forward to giving a talk <b>about tables</b> and discussing the challenging problems and applications of TRL with peers!

It has always been a pleasure to talk about data management with peers from Germany, so I am happy to visit them!
