  Hi, I am Madelon Hulsebos, a PhD student at the University of Amsterdam and intern at Sigma Computing.<br>
  I am interested in <b>table representations and models</b>, and their applications in <b>data management</b> like data integration, search and validation.
  </p>

  <p>
  In 2018, at the MIT Media Lab, I got the opportunity to develop <b><a href="https://sherlock.media.mit.edu/" target="_blank">Sherlock</a></b>, a deep learning model aimed at accurately inferring table semantics at scale.
  The massive interest from industry in Sherlock inspired me to start a PhD (2020) at the <a href="https://indelab.org" target="_blank">INDE Lab (UvA)</a> to focus on improving table models and their applicability in practice.
  A piece of this puzzle is <b><a href="https://gittables.github.io/" target="_blank">GitTables</a></b>: a large-scale dataset of tables extracted from CSV files on GitHub, enriched with table semantics.
  </p>

  <p>
  I helped organizing the SemTab '21 challenge, and reviewed for NeurIPS '21 (Datasets & Benchmarks track), WWW '22 (Industry track), and EDBT '22 (Industry track).
  Besides academia, I am member of the supervisory board of a student consulting firm and was a data scientist for 2+ years.
