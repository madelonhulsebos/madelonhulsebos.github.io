   Hi, I am Madelon Hulsebos. I have been a data scientist since 2019, where I currently work for Heineken.
  </p>
  <p>
   Throughout the last few years, I heard many stories about how organisations struggle to unlock the value in their data due to unaligned data source systems. I also observed it myself.
   In 2018 at the MIT Media Lab, I got the chance to contribute a method (<a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1905.10688.pdf">Sherlock</a>) to tackle semantic type detection for tabular data which is meant to partly solve this issue.
  </p>
   With the rapid developments in the field of NLP, I believe there is a lot to gain in this area for the upcoming years.
   Actually, I will contribute to this myself, as I will be a PhD candidate at the <a href="https://indelab.org/">INDE Lab</a> Lab of the University of Amsterdam supervised by Paul Groth with &#199;a&#x0011F;atay Demiralp as my co-supervisor.
   During my PhD I will continue my research in recovering semantics from tabular data.
