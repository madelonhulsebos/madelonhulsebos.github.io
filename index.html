  Hi, I am Madelon Hulsebos, a PhD student at the University of Amsterdam and intern at Sigma Computing.
  I am interested in systems that capture <b>table semantics</b> using <b>machine learning</b> and their applications in <b>data management</b> like data integration, search and validation.
  </p>

  <p>
  In 2018, at the MIT Media Lab, I got the opportunity to develop <b><a href="https://sherlock.media.mit.edu/" target="_blank">Sherlock</a></b>, a deep learning model aimed at accurately inferring table semantics at scale.
  The massive interest from industry in Sherlock inspired me to start a PhD (2020) at the <a href="https://indelab.org" target="_blank">INDE Lab (UvA)</a> to focus on improving semantic table models and their applicability in practice.
  A piece to this puzzle is <b><a href="https://gittables.github.io/" target="_blank">GitTables</a></b>, a large-scale dataset of tables extracted from GitHub and enriched with table semantics.
  </p>

  <p>
  I reviewed for NeurIPS '21 (Datasets & Benchmarks track), WWW '22 (Industry track), and EDBT '22 (Industry track), and served in the organizing committee of SemTab '21.
  Besides academia, I am member of the supervisory board of a student consulting firm and was a data scientist for over 2 years.
