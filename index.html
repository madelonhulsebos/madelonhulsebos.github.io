   Hi, I am Madelon Hulsebos. I have been a data scientist since 2019, where I currently work for Heineken.
  </p>
  <p>
   Throughout the last few years, I heard many stories about organisations that struggle to unlock the value in their data due to unaligned data source systems. I also observed it myself.
   In 2018 at the MIT Media Lab, I got the chance to contribute a method (<a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1905.10688.pdf">Sherlock</a>) to tackle semantic type detection for tabular data at scale, which is meant to partly solve this issue.
  </p>
   Stimulated by the rapid advances in the field of NLP, I believe accurately recovering semantics from tabular data is within close reach.
   Actually, I contribute to this myself as a PhD candidate at the <a href="https://indelab.org/">INDE Lab</a> Lab at the University of Amsterdam supervised by Paul Groth and co-supervised by &#199;a&#x0011F;atay Demiralp.
