 <h1>Welcome</h1>

  <p>
   Hi, I am Madelon Hulsebos, a PhD student at the University of Amsterdam and intern at Sigma Computing.
  </p>

  <p>
   Throughout the years, I received many messages about organizations that struggle to leverage their databases due to unstandardized and lacking semantic metadata. I also observed this myself as a data scientist.
   In 2018, at the MIT Media Lab, I got the opportunity to contribute a method (<a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1905.10688.pdf" target="_blank">Sherlock</a>) aimed at capturing the column semantics of tables at scale to tackle this problem.
  </p>

  <p>
   Stimulated by the rapid advances in deep learning, I believe accurately recovering semantics from tabular data in practice is within close reach.
   I contribute to this as a PhD student at the <a href="https://indelab.org/" target="_blank">INDE Lab</a> at the University of Amsterdam advised by Prof. Paul Groth and co-advised by &#199;a&#x0011F;atay Demiralp (industry).

    Feel welcome to reach out!
