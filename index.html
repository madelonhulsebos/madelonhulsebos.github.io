 <h1>Welcome</h1>

  <p>
   Hi, I am Madelon Hulsebos. I am a PhD candidate at the University of Amsterdam and a Research Intern at Sigma Computing.

  <p>
   Throughout the years, I heard many stories about organizations that struggle to unlock the value in their databases due to unaligned data source systems and lacking semantic metadata. I also observed it myself.
   In 2018, at the MIT Media Lab, I got the chance to contribute the method (<a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1905.10688.pdf">Sherlock</a>) to tackle semantic type detection for tabular data at scale, which is meant to partly solve this issue.
  </p>
   Stimulated by the rapid advances in the field of natural language processing, I believe accurately recovering semantics from tabular data is within close reach.
   I contribute to this myself as a PhD candidate at the <a href="https://indelab.org/">INDE Lab</a> at the University of Amsterdam advised by Paul Groth and co-advised by &#199;a&#x0011F;atay Demiralp.
