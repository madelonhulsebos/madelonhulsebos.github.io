  Hi! I'm a PhD candidate with the <a href="https://indelab.org" target="_blank">INDE Lab</a> at the <a href="https://www.uva.nl/en" target="_blank">University of Amsterdam</a>.
  So far, my research has been on <b>learned table representations</b> and their <b>applications</b> like data preparation, exploration, and analysis</b>.
  My broader interest is in <b>Intelligent Data Systems</b> with a particular focus on systems for relational tables.
  </p>

  <p>
  My interest in 'learning from tables' started at the MIT Media Lab, where I developed <b><a href="https://sherlock.media.mit.edu/" target="_blank">Sherlock</a></b>, a deep learning method for detecting table semantics at scale, enabling applications like data validation.
  The huge interest from industry in Sherlock and the dominant presence of tables across data systems, inspired me to start a PhD in 2020 to focus on learned table models and their effectiveness in practice.
  A piece of this puzzle is <b><a href="https://gittables.github.io/" target="_blank">GitTables</a></b>: a dataset of 1.7M tables (but continuously growing) extracted from CSV files on GitHub and enriched with table semantics such as semantic column types.
  </p>

  <p>
  In my opinion, tables have been a too long ignored modality for representation learning with too much application potential to ignore. Therefore, I founded the <a href="https://table-representation-learning.github.io" target="blank">Table Representation Learning workshop</a> (hosted at NeurIPS 2022).
  As part of the wider research community, I support <a href="https://jsys.org" target="_blank">JSys</a> as Assistant Editor, co-organize DEEM (SIGMOD 2023) and the <a href="https://www.cs.ox.ac.uk/isg/challenges/sem-tab/" target="_blank">SemTab</a> challenge (2021/2022), and review for various workshops/tracks at e.g. VLDB, EDBT, NeurIPS, WWW.
  Besides academia, I am member of the supervisory board of a student consulting firm and was a data scientist for 2+ years, working on automating ML-driven analyses.
