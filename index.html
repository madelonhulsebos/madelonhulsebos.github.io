  Hi, I am Madelon Hulsebos, a PhD student at the University of Amsterdam and intern at Sigma Computing.<br>
  I am interested in <b>learned table representations</b>, and their applications in <b>data management</b> like data integration, search and validation.
  </p>

  <p>
  At the MIT Media Lab, I got the opportunity to develop <b><a href="https://sherlock.media.mit.edu/" target="_blank">Sherlock</a></b>, a method for accurately detecting table semantics at scale based on deep learning.
  The massive interest from industry in Sherlock inspired me to start a PhD (2020) at the <a href="https://indelab.org" target="_blank">INDE Lab (UvA)</a> to focus on improving table models and their applicability in practice.
  A piece of this puzzle is <b><a href="https://gittables.github.io/" target="_blank">GitTables</a></b>: a dataset of 1.7M tables (and continuously growing) extracted from CSV files on GitHub, enriched with table semantics.
  </p>

  As part of the research community, I helped organizing the SemTab '21 challenge, and reviewed for NeurIPS '21 (Datasets & Benchmarks track), WWW '22 (Industry track), and EDBT '22 (Industry track).
  Besides academia, I am member of the supervisory board of a student consulting firm and was a data scientist for 2+ years. My <a href="https://madelonhulsebos.github.io/assets/Resume%20M.%20Hulsebos.pdf" target="_blank">resume</a> includes more background.
