   Hi, I am Madelon Hulsebos. I have been a data scientist since 2019, where I currently work for Heineken.
  </p>
  <p>
   Throughout the last few years, I heard many stories about how organisations struggle to unlock the value in their data due to unaligned data source systems. I also observed it myself.
   In 2018 at the MIT Media Lab, I got the chance to contribute a method (<a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1905.10688.pdf">Sherlock</a>) to tackle semantic type detection for tabular data which is meant to partly solve this issue.
  </p>
   With the increased need for alignment and understanding of tabular data at scale, and the rapid developments in the field of NLP, I believe there is a lot to gain in this area over the coming years.
   Actually, I will contribute to this myself, as I will be a PhD candidate at the <a href="https://indelab.org/">INDE Lab</a> Lab at University of Amsterdam supervised by Paul Groth with &#199;a&#x011x;atay Demiralp as my co-supervisor.
   During my PhD I will continue my work in the detection of semantics in tabular data.
