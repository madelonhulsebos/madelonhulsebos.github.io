abstract: "Language models, such as GPT-3.5 and ChatGPT, demonstrate remarkable abilities to follow diverse human instructions and perform a wide range of tasks. However, when probing language models using a range of basic table-understanding tasks, we observe that today's language models are still sub-optimal in many table-related tasks, likely because they are pre-trained predominantly on one-dimensional natural-language texts, whereas relational tables are two-dimensional objects."
